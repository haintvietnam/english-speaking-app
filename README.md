## 🔊 Voice Chatbot Technology

### Web Speech API Integration

The voice chatbot leverages cutting-edge browser technologies:

**Speech Recognition (Speech-to-Text):**
```javascript
// Browser compatibility detection
if ('webkitSpeechRecognition' in window) {
    this.recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
} else if ('SpeechRecognition' in window) {
    this.recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
}

// Configuration for English learning
this.recognition.continuous = false;     // Single utterance mode
this.recognition.interimResults = false; // Final results only
this.recognition.lang = 'en-US';        // English language
```

**Speech Synthesis (Text-to-Speech):**
```javascript
// Voice selection for optimal learning
const voices = this.synthesis.getVoices();
const femaleVoice = voices.find(voice => 
    voice.name.includes('Female') || 
    voice.name.includes('Samantha') || 
    voice.name.includes('Karen')
);

// Optimized speech parameters
this.currentUtterance.rate = 0.9;    // Slightly slower for clarity
this.currentUtterance.pitch = 1;     // Natural pitch
this.currentUtterance.volume = 0.8;  // Comfortable volume
```

### Intelligent Response System

**Context-Aware Processing:**
- **Greeting Detection**: Recognizes hello, hi, hey variations
- **Topic Recognition**: Weather, time, learning-specific queries
- **Fallback Responses**: Engaging default responses for unknown inputs
- **Response Randomization**: Varied replies to maintain engagement

**Natural Language Processing Flow:**
1. **Speech Capture**: Voice input converted to text
2. **Intent Analysis**: Keyword matching and context detection
3. **Response Generation**: Appropriate reply selection
4. **Voice Synthesis**: Text converted back to speech
5. **Conversation Loop**: Automatic return to listening (in call mode)

### Audio Processing Pipeline

**Real-time Audio Handling:**
```javascript
// MediaRecorder for audio capture
this.recorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
this.recorder.ondataavailable = (e) => {
    this.chunks.push(e.data);
};

// Blob creation for audio playback
const blob = new Blob(this.chunks, { 
    type: "audio/ogg; codecs=opus" 
});
```

**State Management:**
- **Recording States**: Idle, listening, processing, speaking
- **Call States**: Regular chat vs. continuous call mode
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- **Permission Management**: Microphone access request and handling
